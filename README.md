# Betting on events

Any user can start a pool for a certain outcome <br />
People can deposit their tokens into the pool <br />
Validators will stake their token to input the correct outcome of an event <br />
Once 2/3 consensus on validation is received, the pool gets dissolved as follows
- Part of the tokens are given to validators 
- Rest of the tokens are distributed to winners based on their initial input
- All validators that acted in bad faith lose their tokens

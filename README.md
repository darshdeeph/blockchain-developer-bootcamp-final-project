Betting on events

Any user can start a pool for a certain outcome
People can deposit their tokens into the pool
Validators will stake their token to input the correct outcome of an event
Once 2/3 consensus on validation is received, the pool gets dissolved as follows
  Part of the tokens are given to validators 
  Rest of the tokens are distributed to winners based on their initial input
  All validators that acted in bad faith lose their tokens
